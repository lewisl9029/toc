# Toc Messenger

[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/lewisl9029/toc.png?label=ready&title=Ready)](https://waffle.io/lewisl9029/toc)

VERY ROUGH DRAFT:

An Instant Messaging platform that respects its users.

Designed to protect your privacy. Distributed contact discovery using Bittorrent DHT, end-to-end encrypted message transport using Telehash, allowing you to opt-out of mass surveillance by completely bypassing centralized servers, optional, encrypted, federated user data storage using remotestorage.io.

Designed to preserve your sanity. User-friendly interface, available on all clients, mobile, web, and desktop, all the features you'd expect to see on a modern instant messaging application (multimedia communications, message history, simultaneous login, pseudo offline messaging).

Designed to pave a way towards a better future for messaging applications. Fully open source implementation, well-documented message protocol and data format, designed to be interoperable from the start.
