# Emmett - a custom events emitter for Node.js and the browser
**version: 2.1.2**

## Description

**Emmett** is a custom events emitter for Node.js and the browser. It has initially been developed as domino.emitter, to deal with communication in domino.js, a JavaScript cascading controller for rich internet applications.

I invite you to read [emmett's code](./emmett.js) to know more about how it works. To see examples, you can check the unit tests in [test/emmett.test.js](./test/emmett.test.js).

Finally, if you see bugs or features that would improve the library, feel free to report them on the related [Github issues page](https://github.com/jacomyal/emmett/issues).

## Install

First, you can install emmett from NPM: `npm install --save emmett`, or directly save locally the [`emmett.min.js`](./emmett.min.js) minified file.

Also, you can install the development version:
 1. Clone the repository: `git clone http://github.com/jacomyal/emmett`
 2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
 3. Check the unit tests: `npm test`
 4. Get a minified version (`./emmett.min.js`): `npm build`
