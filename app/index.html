              Toc has been built from the ground up to ensure that it simply <i>can't</i> collect data from users.

            [Why should I care?]

            Great question.

            [Why should I trust you?]

            A skeptic. We like that. =)

            You shouldn't need to trust us. And we've gone great lengths to ensure that you don't have to trust us.

            Toc runs directly on your devices, and does not depend on any external servers. It finds your contacts via a dynamic network of online Toc users, and then forms direct, secure communication channels between you and your contacts to deliver your messages.

            Toc stores data directly on your devices, so your contacts, history, and settings are never exposed to the internet. It also encrypts your data with your password, so even if you lose your device, your data remains safe as long as you keep your password secure.

            Toc also offers the option of synchronizing your data using a cloud storage service so that you can have the same great experience with all your contacts, history, and settings available on any number of devices, even simultaneously. And since all your data is encrypted, you won't even need to trust Dropbox or Google to respect your privacy.

            All of this talk would mean nothing if we can't back it up, which is why Toc's development process going forward will be 100% transparent, with all of the components of Toc being open-source and hosted on GitHub.
