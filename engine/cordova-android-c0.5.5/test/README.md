# Android Native Tests

These tests are designed to verify Android native features and other Android specific features.
They currently are in disrepair, and don't pass / work on KitKat+ :(.

## Initial Setup

### Setting env vars

Run:

    ../bin/check_reqs

Use the output to set your `ANDROID_HOME` and `JAVA_HOME` environment variables.

### Adding `gradlew`

Copy it from a freshly created project:

    ../bin/create foo
    (cd foo && cordova/build --gradle; cp -r gradlew gradle ..)
    rm -r foo

### Robotium

Robotium has to be installed for the onScrollChanged tests to work correctly.  It can be
found at https://code.google.com/p/robotium/ and the jar should be put in the
'androidTests/libs' directory'.

    mkdir -p androidTests/libs && curl 'http://dl.bintray.com/robotium/generic/robotium-solo-5.2.1.jar' > androidTests/libs/robotium-solo-5.2.1.jar

## Running

To run manual tests:

    ./gradlew installDebug

To run unit tests:

    ./gradlew connectedAndroidTest

## Android Studio

1. Use "Non-Android Studio Project" to import the `test` directory.
2. Right click on the `junit` package in the left-side nav
3. Select "Debug"`->`_The one with the Android icon_
