sass-spec
=========

A test suite for Sass. The test cases are all in the `/spec` folder
and are organized, primarily, for the use of libsass development.

All tests in the `spec/todo` folder are expected to fail with libsass.

Run tests with the `sass-spec.rb` file in the root directory.

    ./sass-spec.rb 

Full text help is available if you run that w/ the help options.
